Welcome! This repository is my personal portfolio - a collection of work that highlights my transition from a background in graphic design and communications to my current journey into web development.

## About me
I graduated with a degree in Graphic Design and Communications, where I developed a strong foundation in visual design, layout, and digital media using tools like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign.

In recent months, I've begun expanding my skill set into web development through The Odin Project, where I'm learning to bring my visual creativity into interactive and responsive web experiences.

## What You'll Find Here
This portfolio showcases a mix of my work:
- Graphic & Print Projects - Professional and personal design work created with Adobe Creative Suite.
- Web Development Projects - Exercises and projects from The Odin Project that demonstrate my growing skills in front-end development.
- Learning Experiments - Code challenges and smaller projects as I explore JavaScript, problem-solving, and modern web tools.

## Current Focus
